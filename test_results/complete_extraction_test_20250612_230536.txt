By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1.  Policy.  During 2020, the last year of the prior administration, homicides in the Nation increased nearly 30 percent over the previous year — the largest 1-year increase in murders ever recorded.  After that, the Vice President and I took action to reduce gun crime and other forms of violent crime.  By the middle of 2022, we had already taken more executive action to reduce gun violence than any other administration at that point in time.  On June 25, 2022, I signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (Public Law 117-159) — the most significant new gun violence prevention law in nearly 30 years.  Rates of homicide in the United States are falling at one of the fastest rates ever recorded.  Year-over-year comparison shows that 2023 had one of the largest declines in the homicide rate in recent history.  This life-saving progress has continued in 2024.  While we have made great progress, much more work remains to be done to reduce gun violence and save lives.
It is the policy of my Administration to coordinate across executive departments and agencies (agencies) to reduce gun violence and save lives.  This order directs enhanced coordination for two key challenges:  combating emerging firearms threats and understanding and improving school-based active-shooter drills.

### Summary of Key Points from the Webpage

#### **Policy and Background**
- **Homicide Increase**: In 2020, homicides in the U.S. increased by nearly 30%, the largest 1-year increase ever recorded.
- **Executive Actions**: By mid-2022, the current administration had taken more executive actions to reduce gun violence than any other administration at that point.
- **Legislation**: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (Public Law 117-159) was signed into law on June 25, 2022, marking the most significant new gun violence prevention law in nearly 30 years.
- **Progress**: Homicide rates are falling at one of the fastest rates ever recorded, with 2023 seeing one of the largest declines in recent history. This progress continued into 2024.

#### **Administration's Policy**
- **Coordination Across Agencies**: The policy aims to coordinate across executive departments and agencies to reduce gun violence and save lives.
- **Key Challenges**: The order focuses on two main challenges: combating emerging firearms threats and understanding and improving school-based active-shooter drills.

#### **Combating Emerging Firearms Threats**
- **Initial Actions**: In April 2021, the administration took action to stop the proliferation of "ghost guns" (firearms without serial numbers).
- **Emerging Threats Center**: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) established an Emerging Threats Center to identify developments in illicit firearm marketplaces, including 3D-printed firearms and machinegun conversion devices.
- **Bump Stocks**: The administration disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision to strike down regulations on bump stocks and calls for Congress to clarify that these devices are machineguns.
- **Machinegun Conversion Devices**: These devices enable semiautomatic firearms to match or exceed the rate of fire of military machineguns. From 2017 to 2021, ATF recovered 5,454 such devices, a 570% increase over the previous 5-year period.
- **3D Printed Firearms**: Unserialized and undetectable 3D-printed firearms pose a significant threat, as they can be produced without serial numbers and are difficult to trace. They can also be rendered undetectable by magnetometers.
- **National Security Risks**: These threats pose risks to national security and foreign policy interests, as they

### Summary of Key Points from the Webpage

**Document Title:** Executive Order on Combating Emerging Firearms Threats and Improving School-Based Active-Shooter Drills | The White House

**Main Content:**
1. **Policy Overview:**
   - Homicides in the U.S. increased by nearly 30% in 2020, the largest 1-year increase ever recorded.
   - The current administration has taken significant executive actions to reduce gun violence, including signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022.
   - Homicide rates are declining, but more work is needed to reduce gun violence and save lives.
   - The policy aims to enhance coordination across federal agencies to address two key challenges: combating emerging firearms threats and improving school-based active-shooter drills.

2. **Emerging Firearms Threats:**
   - The administration has established an Emerging Threats Center within the ATF to identify and combat new technologies in illicit firearm markets.
   - The Supreme Court's decision on bump stocks did not change the statutory prohibition on machinegun conversion devices.
   - Machinegun conversion devices enable semiautomatic firearms to match or exceed the rate of fire of military machineguns.
   - There has been a significant increase in the recovery of these devices, often illegally imported or 3D printed.
   - Unserialized, 3D printed firearms pose a threat to domestic and international security, as they can be used for illicit purposes and are undetectable by magnetometers.

3. **School Safety and Active-Shooter Drills:**
   - The administration has invested in school safety, focusing on preventing unauthorized access to firearms and supporting evidence-based safety measures.
   - Since 1999, there have been over 400 school shootings, exposing more than 375,000 students to gun violence.
   - 95% of K-12 public schools in the U.S. conduct lockdown drills, but there is limited research on their effectiveness and potential psychological impacts.
   - The administration is working to develop and publish information on best practices for designing and conducting effective and age-appropriate active-shooter drills.

4. **Executive Actions:**
   - Establishment of an interagency Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force to address the proliferation of machinegun conversion devices and 3D printed firearms.
   - Development and publication of information on school-based active-shooter drills, including best practices and recommended areas for future research.
